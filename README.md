## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11 or later
- Android SDK with minimum API level 24
- Google Services configuration

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Configure your `google-services.json`
5. Build and run the application

## ðŸ“± Application Architecture

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with MVVM pattern:
- `data`: Contains repositories, data sources, and database implementations
- `domain`: Business logic and use cases
- `ui`: Compose UI components and screens
- `utils`: Helper classes and utilities
- `di`: Dependency injection modules

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The application uses different URLs for development and production:
- Base URL: `https://roblocks.pythonanywhere.com`
- Classifier URL: `http://10.10.193.199:5000`

##  Dependencies

Major dependencies include:
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Dagger Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit for networking
- Room for local database
- TensorFlow Lite for AI capabilities
- Firebase for authentication and analytics
